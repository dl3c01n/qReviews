Sorry, i'm more comfortable about the back-end parts, not a good front developer :D
# Introduction

As a student, i wanted to know how people judge me, how they perceive me professionally. For my exams, i could just write "I am a good team mate", which can be true or false. I decided to maybe make a project for my team mates where they can just write what they think about me.


# Go further

Maybe integrate this as a Review system about a Product, Website, Movie, or even inside core projects. Rest API can be used standalone and customizable.
